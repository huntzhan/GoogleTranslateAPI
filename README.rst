Motivation
==========

After released `mgd v0.1 <https://github.com/haoxun/MyGoogleDict>`__\ (a
command-line front end of google translation service), I realized that
there's few mature python package could fulfill my requirements, such as
fine-grained single word translation and TTS service. This project is
proposed for providing an end solution of google translation api.

This project is mainly inspired by
`goslate <https://bitbucket.org/zhuoqiang/goslate>`__ and
`Google-Translate-TTS <https://github.com/hungtruong/Google-Translate-TTS/>`__.

Functionality
=============

-  Normal translation serve, including single-word translation with
   multiple explanation and long sentences translation.
-  Support Google TTS and phonogram.
